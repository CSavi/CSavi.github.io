This project was filled with an array of emotions from high to low and then back up to a double-high upon submission. DCDrinks is a CLI application that scrapes data from a DC-local, venue site and displays happy hours with their associated details by a numbered weekday selector. This idea was inspired by my own frustrations of living in DC with little ease in finding happy hours after work on the fly.

When a user opens the app, they will be prompted to select a number for the day of the week to view its list of available happy hours, ie., Monday(1), Tuesday(2), etc. If they choose a number other than 1-7, they will be prompted with similar initial instructions or the option to ‘exit.’ Once they select a numbered weekday, they will see a list of scrapped happy hours, along with their area of location, happy hour times, and happy hour features. Wherever they type ‘exit,’ they will be thanked for choosing my app and encouraged to return for another venture. 

The biggest take-away I got from this project, other than learning to debug better with pry, was taking the time to think and write down what I wanted to create from start to finish. Being ‘big-picture’ has it’s advantages, but can easily drown out the smaller details that connect the bigger dots. I became overwhelmed when I knew what I wanted in my head, but unsure how to create the steps to get there. A coach was helpful in sharing the danger of coding too early and instead, allowing more time to write an outline of what I wanted to create -the way to get from point A to point B. After spending a good chunk of time writing out my plan, it was amazing to see how quickly everything came together as I built the app one block at a time, and less overwhelming when the hiccups came -and come they will. The completion of my first little ‘masterpiece’ was an exhilarating moment to say the least.
