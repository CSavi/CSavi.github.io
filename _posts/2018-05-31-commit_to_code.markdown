Solving problems, building ideas, and dissecting computer languages became an addictive hobby to start. I was first exposed to the world of coding through my government job. My boss has a background in IT and is a strong forward-thinker. He allowed me to assist him in re-creating our committee's website and build personalized apps for the staff -making their lives significantly easier with less mess. Knowing nothing about code or even design, I found myself creating flow charts for the apps and learning to think and converse with software developers in LA on how we wanted this world-renowned committee website and app funtionality to be seen. So began my exploration into coding land. 

I started working through many free coding programs and classes online and found many overtones from my study of music in university. Not only learning the theory behind the language of music, but also the expression of music, carried many familiar characteristics and approaches that are found in coding. Programming, like music, is not just a language. It is an art. 

The reliable snowball effect happened. After much research into online coding bootcamps and conversations with friends who had experienced them, I decided to take the plunge. And so glad I did.
